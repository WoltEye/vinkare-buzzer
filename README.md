# Vinkare Buzzer

A small project for a youtuber called [Vinkare](https://www.youtube.com/@Vinkare/videos)

## What does the app do?
In the application you can create up to 8 "buzzer buttons", each button has a name that the user can choose and a keyboard key attached to the button when the selected key is pressed it simulates pressing the buzzer button. When the game is started and one or more buttons are pressed the application calculates which button was pressed first and displays the name of that button on the screen.

## Why?
[Vinkare](https://www.youtube.com/@Vinkare/videos) (The youtuber) has a "show" called "Arvaa mit√§ katsojat vastasivat" ("Guess what the followers answered") where the "host" asks questions and the team who is the first one to press the buzzer button gets to answer first. This process is done manually and it's sometimes really hard to tell who is the first one that pressed the button.
